This repository contains materials for **Lab 01 — Lab Setup (1 of 2): Virtualization** from CSE241.

## Getting Started

A step-by-step tutoring guide is available in [STEPS.md](STEPS.md).

It covers each lab task **one step at a time**, with:
- **How to do it** — clear, technical instructions for every step.
- **What is its purpose?** — the goal of each step and why it matters.

## Equation Solver

A simple Python equation solver is included in [`solver.py`](solver.py).

**Supported equation types:**

| Type | Form |
|------|------|
| Linear | ax + b = 0 |
| Quadratic | ax² + bx + c = 0 |

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 solver.py
```

The interactive prompt will ask you to choose the equation type and enter the coefficients, then print the solution(s).

**Example — quadratic x² − 5x + 6 = 0:**

```
Choose equation type (1 or 2): 2
Enter a: 1
Enter b: -5
Enter c: 6
Two roots: x₁ = 3.0,  x₂ = 2.0
```
